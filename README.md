# Code-Quiz
A timed quiz using JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores

## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria

I will have met the brief when the following acceptance criteria are met:

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score


## Installation

No particular installation requirements. Web page can be viewed using Chrome, Firefox, Safari or most other standard browser, using "Inspect" Console to see the output 
The "Application" tab in Inspect can be used to see the scores which have been saved to LocalStorage.
